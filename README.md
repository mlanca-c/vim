# Intro

 ```Vim``` is different from other text editors. Although it looks hard to learn, there are only two main ideas you need to really understand it. Those two are actually what makes Vim so different from other text editors. They are **modal editing** and **operators**.

 > ```Modal Editing```: the purpose of Vim is to enable you to edit text effectively. Because you spend more time editing than entering the text, Vim makes editing and navigation more powerful than any other text editor.

 > ```Operators```: Operator commands (or operators) can delete, change or insert text, copy or format it, etc.

# Personalizing Vim

 If you’ve had any experience with some of the text editors for programmers, it’s most likely you’ll be disappointed with how ```Vim``` looks. But this is actually a good thing. While other editors try to force you use their features, ```Vim``` does the opposite.

 The “interface” is very minimal. This means that you have to spend some time and effort to make the ```Vim``` interface look pretty, as well as to improve your productivity. The benefit is this process of configuration will help you understand better how ```Vim``` works.
