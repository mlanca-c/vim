 ```Vim``` is different from other text editors. Although it looks hard to learn, there are only two main
ideas you need to really understand it. Those two are actually what makes Vim so different
from other text editors. They are **modal editing** and **operators**.

 If you’ve had any experience with some of the text editors for programmers, it’s most likely
you’ll be disappointed with how ```Vim``` looks. But this is actually a good thing. While other editors
try to force you use their features, ```Vim``` does the opposite.

 The “interface” is very minimal. This means that you have to spend some time and effort to
make the ```Vim``` interface look pretty, as well as to improve your productivity. The benefit is this
process of configuration will help you understand better how ```Vim``` works.
